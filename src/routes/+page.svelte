    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to Project ELysium</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Project ELysium is a proposal for building a homemade 3D printer. This
        project will serve as our 3rd semester IoT-themed project.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Project?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        3D printing is an open platform - that means that anyone can build a 3D
        printer using off-the-shelf components. We estimate that a 3D printer
        made from scratch will be about 7-10 times cheaper than commercially
        available models.

        This isn't just a cost-effective solution - its more about how we can efficiently
        make use of the resources we already have.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Inspiration</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        We want to democratize 3D printing technology by making it accessible to
        students and enthusiasts. 3d printers cost upwards of 20,000 INR, which
        is a significant investment for students. Additive manufacturing is a
        powerful tool for prototyping and creating custom parts, and we believe
        that everyone should have access to this technology.
